Just lock the sea of stars behind chapter 1 and the new story can fit into it. The multiverse isn't new to Nikki. Another not-new issue is that the photo sharing is too limited.

0161cb45-6242-462e-86e6-f75ba182f27e,"Despite the 1.5 update being disappointing for a lot of us, I strongly believe the team working on this game LISTENS and CARES. That matters a lot to me as a player. I have fun playing this game. It brings me joy and makes me feel so seen as a female gamer. We honestly need to be all a bit more patient with the development of Infinity Nikki... Feedback, both positive and negative, is important. But complaining indefinitely won't help anybody.",5,2025-06-30 12:06:17,3

The ONLY thing I wish was different is that I wish you pound use touchscreen and controller simultaneously. Other than that, I havent had any issues with the mobile game. I love that its cross-platform, so I can just pick up my game on the go when im at work or away from my gaming PC. And as for the game in general, I am still blown away by the amount of content in this FREE game. It is absolutely insane.",5,2025-06-29 09:25:28,5

Look at the reviews. Notice how they're mostly either 1 star or 5 star with no in-between? Shame on this company. I was really excited for where the story would go. I used to sing this game's praises. But it's only a shell of what it used to be now.",1,2025-06-28 20:11:17,323

I understand people have thier frustration with the game. But review bombing and throwing a temper tantrum will not make the game better.

I used to really love this game, and was so excited when it first came out due to being a player of the companies other games for so long. However, I dislike it now because of all the changes, bugs, and glitches now in the game. An example would be that they changed the whole storyline for the beginning, and the 1.5 update ruined a lot of things. Also, although I adore the dying system, why do I have to buy due for every single piece? I'm just disappointed overall.",1,2025-06-27 17:33:44,26

e57c5bd2-bde7-46c5-890b-3cc14c2dd485,Best mobile game of all time! I've been playing this game for at least 6 months. I've still not lost interest. The graphics are stunning. The story lines are engaging and it's possible to play without spending a penny. I usually pay for the extra reward levels each update but it's not essential. The downside is there's no way you could get the 5 star outfits without it. Though I'm disappointed I still don't have the 5 star outfit. 11 items is too many! I.N. please make it easier!,5,2025-06-27 13:07:38,1

I used to login almost everyday to do my dailies, but that's impossible now with the crashes. I've got a Samsung S23 Ultra with upgraded storage, a two year old top of the line phone should be able to run a game without crashing every 2 minutes...
